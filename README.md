### Howdy, I'm Serdar!

Welcome to my Github space! 

Here's where to find me and what I'm working on:

- Currently working on reimplementing [http://kilic.net](https://kilic.net) using [Strapi CMS](https://strapi.io)
- Posting my Wordle score, random text, and happenings at [twitter.com/serdar](https://twitter.com/serdar)
- Some snapshots posted to [instagram.com/serdarkilic](https://instagram.com/serdarkilic) but this will eventually be incorporated into my main site.

Once upon a time I was posting photos to [https://flic.kr/serdar](https://flic.kr/serdar) - but the web has changed and flickr unfortunately didn't change for the better!

Weening myself off from Twitter to <a rel="me" href="https://hachyderm.io/@serdar">Mastodon</a>, chat with me there!
